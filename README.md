üè¶ ATM Machine Simulation

Designed and developed an ATM Machine Simulation in Python to demonstrate core object-oriented programming concepts. The project features secure encapsulation of sensitive data such as PIN and account balance, with authentication mechanisms to validate user access. Functionalities include deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry, along with robust error handling for scenarios like incorrect PIN entry, insufficient balance, and invalid transactions. This project reflects how Python OOP can be applied to simulate real-world banking systems.
