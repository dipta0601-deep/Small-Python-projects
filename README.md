# Small Python Projects

A collection of beginner-to-intermediate Python projects demonstrating core programming concepts and OOP principles. These mini-projects are good exercises for honing your Python skills, exploring basic algorithms, user interaction, file I/O, and object-oriented design.

## üìÇ Project List

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **ATM MACHINE SIMULATION** | A console-based ATM simulator. Users can log in, view balance, withdraw, deposit, and change PIN. |
| **Basic Calculator** | A simple Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations, maybe extended for error handling and input validation. |
| **E-Commerce Shopping** | A rudimentary shopping cart simulation: browse products, add to cart, remove from cart, view totals, checkout. |
| **Number Guessing Game** | The classic ‚Äúguess a random number‚Äù game, with user input, feedback (‚Äútoo high‚Äù, ‚Äútoo low‚Äù), and limited attempts. |
| **Password Strength Checker** | A script to check if a password meets certain criteria (length, presence of uppercase/lowercase, digits, symbols, etc.). |
| **Snake Water Gun Game** | A Python reimplementation of the ‚ÄúSnake-Water-Gun‚Äù game (similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors) with user vs computer turns. |
| **Student Management System** | *(If present)* Manage student records: add, update, delete, search student data, possibly using file I/O or simple in-memory structures. |
| **Library Book System** | *(If present)* A basic library management console system: issue books, return books, view available books/users. |

*(Adjust the project list based on the actual files you have.)*

## üß© Why this repository exists

- To document and share small, self-contained Python projects that reinforce fundamentals.
- To showcase progress over time: from simple scripts to more structured code using functions and classes.
- To serve as a practise playground for newcomers to Python, or as small portfolio pieces for interview preparation or learning.
